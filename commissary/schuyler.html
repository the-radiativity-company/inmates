			<i><b><font face="Tahoma">Code of Ethics<br>
			</font></b></i><br>
			As law enforcement officers, our fundamental duty is to serve 
			mankind, to safeguard lives and property, to protect the innocent 
			against deception, the weak against oppression or intimidation and 
			the peaceful against violence or disorder, and to respect the 
			Constitutional Rights of all men to liberty, equality and justice. I 
			will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all. I will 
			maintain courageous and calm in the face of danger, scorn or 
			ridicule. I will develop self-restraint and be constantly mindful of 
			the welfare of others. Honest in thought and deed in both my 
			personal and official life. I will be exemplary in obeying the laws 
			of the land and the regulations of my Department. Whatever I see or 
			hear of a confidential nature of that which is confided to me in my 
			official capacity will be kept ever secret unless revelation is 
			necessary in the performance of my duty. I will never act 
			officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, animosities, or 
			friendships to influence my decisions. With no compromise for crime 
			and with relentless prosecution of criminals, I will enforce the law 
			courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice or ill 
			will, never employing unnecessary force or violence and never 
			accepting gratuities. I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol 
			of public faith, and I accept it as a public trust to be held so 
			long as I am true to the ethics of the police service. I will 
			constantly strive to achieve these objectives and ideals, dedicating 
			myself before my profession: Law Enforcement.</p>
